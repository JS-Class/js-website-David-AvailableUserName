        <h2>A Webpage About Me</h2>

        <h3>Introductions</h3>
        <p>
            Starting off, my name is David. I am currently enrolled in college for Computer Programming 
            as my major. This webpage will be talking about my interests, my goals, and other basic 
            information about me as a person. All of this information will be broken into sections that 
            go further indepth.
            
        </p>

        <h3>Things About Me</h3>
        <p>
            As stated before my name is David and I am into Computer Programming. I initially got into 
            Computer Programming at Four County where I went through my last two years of highschool. 
            I then went straight into college the following year following that same path into 
            Computer Programming. The start of college was a rough start for me, but at this point I am 
            holding strong and I am performing much better than when I first started. 
            <br>
            Since I went into collge straight from highschool, I am obviosly not as old as probably a majority of 
            other students if I am to go off of my previous classes students. With that said, I am currently 21 years old and 
            if it matters to anybody, my height is also 6'1. 
            <br>
            With the basic information out of the way, I can now talk about why I wanted to go into Computer Programming
            and what I enjoy about it. I started at Four County of course, and when I was deciding on what I wanted to do, a 
            big reason for deciding on Computer Programming was mostly because I thought it would be fun. I also can't 
            disclude the allure of a high paying job sitting in air conditioning or even the potential of game design and development.
            While those reasons still hold some weight in why I decided to continue into college, they are not as important now 
            after I have figured out what I want to do in life. For now my main reasons are that I am genuinely interested 
            and do find programming to be fun, but the visual feedback and seeing my work build into a game is my main focus. 
            So with that I decided that Computer Programming would help me the most because it would allow me to get jobs essentially 
            everywhere in order to always have a way to provide for myself, but would also set me up in knowing the foundations of what 
            I will need for making games and anything else I may find intereset in, in the future.
            <br>
            Now it wouldn't be complete in telling you about myself without some sort of image to follow so I will be including one here 
            of myself below.

        <h3>Basic Interests</h3>
        <p>
            Everyone knows people aren't solely interested in college, or the courses they're enrolled in, but 
            that they also have other interests. So with that a few of my interests would include.
            <ul>
                <li>Reading</li>
                <li>Gaming</li>
                <li>Game Development</li>
                <li>fantasy themes</li>
                <li>And Sweets</li>
            </ul>
            When it comes to reading I have been a major bookworm since before middleschool after I learned that I liked actual reading
            rather than picture books. I used to hate reading and right before it started to impact my learning I found out I wanted to 
            <em>read</em> what I found interesting and not stare at images. This of course caused it's own problems because appearantly 
            reading two or three grade levels above your current grade at atleast two books a week, every week until graduation isn't normal.
            So yeah, I <em>really</em> like reading.
            <br>
            I am going to tie in fantasy and gaming into this next part because they go hand in hand. Fantasy also heavily relates to my reading, but 
            in terms of games at least I have been playing games for a much longer time. So obviosly fantasy has worked it's way into my interests
            along with other sub genres of fantasy or even mixed genres, such as modern/fansty. The majority of games I am interested in however
            is usually shooter games. I do also enjoy racing, open world, survival, and even darksouls style games. 
            <br>
            Now when it comes to game development I actually drift to different games than what I persoanlly play most of the time. 
            I don't have any real projects at this moment because until recently I haven't had the capabilities to even try. However, 
            for ideas that I've written down as I have had them, they typically drift towards more exploration styled games. I'm getting off topic 
            with that though, and what actually interests me about game development is the persoanl feedback I get from it. Being able to see 
            a game be created as I do things, and having instant feedback whenever I break something or fix something while being able to see 
            what is happening in front of my eyes, rather than random error messages and abrupt crashes in other programs. I get a massive amount 
            of satisfaction fron creating a game. 
            <br>
            I obviously have to include food of some sort in my interests. For me that food is sweets, or really anything with a likely unhealthy amount 
            of sugar in it. So candy, cake, brownies, losts of pastries, other baked goods, and also drinks such as pop or I would include juices as well,
            even though juice is healthy. For my entire life I have had a severe sweet tooth and have always loved sweet tasting food, with my all time 
            favorite being peanut butter fudge. 
        </p>
        <!--this line recieves an error when validated saying this end point has no start point, however there clearly is both a start and an end point-->

        <h3>Basic Goals</h3>
        <p>
            For my goals I really don't have too many at this point in time, and the ones I do have are rather basic. For starters I want to finsih 
            college. That is a very simple goal. I want to eventually get the one game project that I am working on to a public playable point. 
            As an addon I also want to create a personal website for that game. As of right now, those are my main goals in their simplest forms. I 
            do have much longer term goals that I honestly won't be able to approach for years to come, and some of these goals I have broken 
            up into smaller goals for myself to keep me on track, but for now I don't need to go into that much detail when they really only affect me.
